Slide deck information

This is the main page, its very basic at the moment but it is very easy to use.
Basically i just used html to link all the pages together and gave them some spacing with css flex.
This home page you can also view my resume and you can also download it if you would like.
It has a current picture of myself.
Under near it has a small message about me becoming a developer.
At the bottom as the footer it has my copywrite.

The second page is a very basic rundown of what I currently do as an electrician and some small photos down the 
bottom of a few various jobs. I chose to put them along the bottom and used flex to allow to see on various devices 


The next page is the about page which is a small bit about myself and what I do for fun, few various photos are 
attached. All the photos are ones that ive taken over the years.

The links page is how you can contact me, they are various different ways that you can do that, they also 
include my GitHub and LinkedIn as per requirement.


The final page is a blog page which houses 5 different pictures with links to various blogs.
Ive also attached my medium account page at the very bottom of the page attached to the 5th image.
They all link to the various topics as per picture.

Design process
A lot of different designs popped through my head during the build, my lack of coding experience was the downfall,
throughout the design I learnt a lot and very quickly. I really wanted this awesome page with bouncy buttons, a 
really cool background of an awesome scenery shot that I took whilst in italy, but i couldnt seem to get it to
work out just right.
I decided to just pick a nice colour and basic button operation for now so that at least i know its easy to use
and find what youre looking for on the page, its extremely easy to navigate because its so basic.
The only special part of it all is they are all my photos taken over the years and im happy to showcase them.
