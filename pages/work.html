    <h3>Im currently working full time as an Industrial Electrician in Coopers
        Plains.
        It can be very challenging at times, but i feel for me to progress forward
        i need to head into the digital field.
        I really enjoy working on programming as ive done a little bit of it
        in the industrial realm, with all the safety of machine guarding and doing
        simple programming on hydraulic systems that need a small bit of IO to
        achieve what is required.
        I also used to run my own business back in Melbourne for over 5 years.
        That was great and extremely rewarding with the amount of people i seen
        and met, but eventually the long hours and the fact I should of employed
        some help, i eventually burnt out and wanted to get out of the game.
        So thats when i switched up and thought time to get a good job as an 
        industrial Electrician and work for some one and close the business.
        Ive attached some pictures of the jobs that we have done over the years.</h3   >
