**Portfolio Desrciption**
*Purpose*
- The purpose of my portfolio it to show you a bit about my self, who I am , where i am coming from and the direction I would like to take in life.
- It is a quick snap shot of my current skill and knowledge that has been learnt in less then 1 month of twice a week training.
- It also includes my resume for PDF download if you require.

*Functionality / Features*

- My portfilio features are very basic at this point, I have various links at the top that go to pages on my portfolio showcasing a brief run down of my previous work, about me, some links on how to contact me and a blog's page for my various blogging articles. I will try and add to these blogs as often as I can.

*Target Audience*

- My target audience is those at Coder Academy for the marking of my portfolio assignemnt for term 1 assignement 1, but im open to any one browsing through, it will be a great way to see how much i progress through the course and just how fast I can learn it all coming from a completely different job.
Also to potential employers who like my style and designs can contact me directly.

*Tech Stack*

 -Through-out the portfolio i used HTML & CSS as I am fairly competenant in those and I feel the product i have delivered meets the criteria, it may not be the prettiest but i feel its robust and extremely easy to navigate and it also is a finished product. In future I would love to add more style and I can really make this look good. I did end up implementing some SCSS into it as well as added security featers SHA-384.
Its deployed on the referred netlify site as its free and easy to use and it was recommended by Coder Academy.
